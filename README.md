## What is Malewicz?

Malewicz is Yet Another GUI DB Manager (like [PgHero](https://github.com/ankane/pghero) or [Pgweb](https://github.com/sosedoff/pgweb)).

- Lightning-fast AJAX web interface - but without a single line of JavaScript (we use [Hotwire Turbo](https://turbo.hotwired.dev))
- SQL-manager written on SQL itself
- Suprematistic - old plain SQL + old plain HTML
- Hackable - Malewicz was originally created specialy for hacking (template driven, live, without compilation and restarting)
- Make your own templates, share it and use foreign templates
- Simple and powerful integration with awesome tools, for charts and diagrams driving and etc.
- Support PostgreSQL for now (but...)

### We were inspired by
- [dbt](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core).
- [YeSQL](https://github.com/krisajenkins/yesql) - Keep the SQL as SQL.
- [Database as Code](https://github.com/mgramin/database-as-code).
